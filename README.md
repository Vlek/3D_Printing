# 3D Printing

This is a repository for managing my printing.

In order to try to learn things quicker and get better prints using a more rigorously scientific approach from my software background, I have decided to make a board to track the prints that I have done, what settings that I have used, and use this as a way to see what works and what doesn't.

### Print board

Currently set up to have three columns, but really I could probably have just To Print, Printing, and Printed.

The information that I am trying to keep track of are things like the gcode file, a list or configuration snapshot of what was used, and what the outcomes were.
