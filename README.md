# 3D Printing

This is a repository for managing my printing.

In order to try to learn things quicker and get better prints using a more rigorously scientific approach from my software background, I have decided to make a board to track the prints that I have done, what settings that I have used, and use this as a way to see what works and what doesn't.

## Print board

## Printer

## Configuration

### Klipper
I was having issues with Octoprint, so I switched over to Klipper. I am hoping to update the repo with my Klipper configuration files eventually.
